		<p>S. o. sinuosus is a smallish rare species of soricine shrew that is distinguished from other vicinity and sympatric shrew taxa by having darker pelage; its occurrence is strictly limited to tidal marshes near San Pablo and Suisun bays, a fact that makes identification and differentiation straightforward.[6] <strong>The</strong> body mass ranges from 4.5 to 6.8 grams, with a total length (including tail) of 98 to 106 millimeters; The tail structure itself is between 35 and 44 millimeters in length.[7] Coloration is usually black, sometimes metallic. S. o. sinuosus has an elongated skull shape, that is relatively narrow and fragile</p>
